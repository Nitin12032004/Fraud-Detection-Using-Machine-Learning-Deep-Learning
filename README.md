This project focuses on building an effective fraud detection system for financial transactions. It tackles the challenge of highly imbalanced data, where fraudulent transactions are rare compared to genuine ones.

Key Highlights:
Performed feature engineering to create meaningful variables such as net balance changes and transaction frequency.
Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance and improve fraud detection performance.
Evaluated multiple models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest
XGBoost
Deep Learning Neural Network (Keras + TensorFlow)
Deep Learning model achieved high recall for fraud detection, making it suitable for minimizing missed fraud alerts.
Model performance measured using classification report, confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and execution time.

Objective:
To build a model that prioritizes high recall for fraud detection (even at the cost of some false positives), ensuring fraudulent transactions are caught and alerted in real time.
